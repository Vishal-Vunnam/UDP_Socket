I wrote a grading script `grade.py` for PA2 reliable file transfer.

This script builds your project, spins up the server and a single interactive client (via a PTY), runs a series of black-box tests, and prints a score out of 100.

Firstly, you have to put the `grade.py` in the same folder with `udp_server.c, udp_client.c, and Makefile`.

The directory layout should be
```
<your-project-root>/
├── Makefile
├── udp_server.c
├── udp_client.c
├── foo1
├── foo2
├── foo3
└── grade.py
```
The provided Makefile:
  - build `server/udp_server` and `client/udp_client`
  - create `server/` and `client/` if needed
  - copy `foo1, foo2, foo3` into `server/`
Tip: the script calls make clean && make automatically.

## What the grader expects your program to support
From the client’s prompt, these commands should be understood by your server:  
  - `ls` — list files available on the server (should include foo1, foo2, foo3)  
  - `get <filename>` — download from server → client  
  - `put <filename>` — upload from client → server  
  - `delete <filename>` — remove from server’s directory  
  - `exit` — gracefully shut down the server process
    
The grader talks only to the client; the server’s `stdout/stderr` are fully suppressed.  

## How the grader runs
  1. Build: `make clean` then `make`
  2. Start server (in background): `cd server && ./udp_server <port>`
  3. Start one client via PTY: `cd client && ./udp_client 127.0.0.1 <port>`
  4. Issue commands to the client (see test list below)  

## Test Cases
| # | Test                        | Points | How it’s graded                                                                                                                                       |
| - | --------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `ls`                        | 15     | Client output must contain `foo1`, `foo2`, `foo3`.                                                                                                    |
| 2 | `get foo1`                  | 15     | After \~5s (configurable), SHA-256(**server/foo1**) == SHA-256(**client/foo1**).                                                                      |
| 3 | `delete foo1` → `ls`        | 15     | `foo1` must **not** appear in the listing.                                                                                                            |
| 4 | `put foo1`                  | 15     | After \~5s, SHA-256(**server/foo1**) == SHA-256(**client/foo1**).                                                                                     |
| 5 | `exit`                      | 15     | Server process must exit cleanly (exit code = `0`) within a short timeout.                                                                                              |
| 6 | **Reliability under netem** | 25     | Restart server/client, apply `tc netem delay X loss Y%`, create \~N MB `server/foo2`, `get foo2`, then hashes must match. qdisc is removed afterward. |

## Usage
Basic run (defaults shown):
```
python3 grade.py \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8000 \
  --timeout 3.0 \
  --wait 5.0 \
  --delete-wait 1.0 \
  --exit-wait 2.0 \
  --foo2-size-mb 5 \
  --loss 5.0 \
  --delay 1ms
```

Argument reference
  - `--host` / `--port` — server address/port passed to udp_client
  - `--timeout` — how long to capture output for ls tests (seconds)
  - `--wait` — wait time after get/put & reliability fetch before hashing (seconds)
  - `--delete-wait` — short settle time after delete (seconds)
  - `--exit-wait` — how long to wait for the server to exit (seconds)
  - `--foo2-size-mb` — size of server/foo2 for the reliability test (MB). Script builds it by concatenating server/foo1 until ~size.
  - `--loss` — packet loss percentage (e.g., 5%, 10%)
  - `--delay` — latency string for netem (e.g., 1ms, 5ms, 0ms)

## Safety notes for netem
The grader applies:
```
sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay <DELAY> loss <LOSS>%
```
and removes it with:
```
sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root
```
This affects only the loopback interface `lo`. Still, don’t interrupt the script to avoid leaving qdisc configured. If you do, you can manually clear it:
```
sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root
```
